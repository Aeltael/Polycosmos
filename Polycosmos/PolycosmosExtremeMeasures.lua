-- Remove this file if empty .lua files aren't functional, or even welcome.

-- Goal: Have Extreme Measures in the Pact of Punishment create the following upgraded bosses per level.
-- 1.) Extreme Measures 4 = Sisters, Lernie, Heroes, Hades
-- 2.) Extreme Measures 3 = Lernie, Heroes, Hades
-- 3.) Extreme Measures 2 = Heroes, Hades
-- 4.) Extreme Measures 4 = Hades

-- For Archipelago in the future, we need to do 2 more things to this file:
-- 1.) When Reverse Heat becomes an option instead of the primary playstyle, this needs to be enabled when Reverse Heat is enabled.
-- 2.) When Reverse Extreme Measures is enabled, look into modifying AP logic to expect one (1) ExtremeMeasurePactLevel item per biome.
